Hey all, hope the beginning of Fall has been treating you well!

Mr. Aubel's running a fundraiser* for Amador's orchestra & choirs. The main event is attendance of the Book of Mormon musical on Feb. 15th, at the Orpheum. He has some tickets left over and is offering them to me/my friends for $100 (which is a steal, I think they're orchestra seats too). I'll be going, and so will Ann and a few of her friends.

If you're interested, let me know! I have no idea how long the tix will be available: you might have a month, but they might also be gone really soon. I know it's super far in advance but with Broadway I think this is often how it works.

Cool, regardless let's all get together sometime before the holidays!

P.S. totally fine to bring a +1, so let me know if you want 2 tix. Even +2/3 would be cool, as long as everyone's willing to pay in advance.

*The complete fundraiser package includes a bus ride from Pleasanton to the city and back. Unfortunately for Pleasantonians among us there's no more room on the bus; Aubel is offering us the wholesale price on the tix :)
